Penguin Species Classification

This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to predict
the species of penguins based on their physical characteristics.
The aim is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify
penguin species using logistic regression.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica) Penguin Data" available on Kaggle.
It contains information about penguins' culmen (beak) length, culmen depth,
flipper length, body mass, sex, and the island where they were found.

Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/penguin_species.git


Install the required Python packages:


pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
    Open the Jupyter Notebook file main.ipynb.
    Run each cell sequentially to load the data, preprocess it, train the model, and predict penguin species.
    Follow the instructions in the notebook to input penguin characteristics and get species predictions.
